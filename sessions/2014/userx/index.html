	<h1>User Interfaces</h1>
</section>

<section>
What are we talking about?

<p>Whenever we write code, we have some user in mind who will interact with it via some an interface.</p>
<p>How do you interact with (your own? someone elses?) software?</p>
</section>

<section>
What broad kinds of interfaces are there?
What kinds of users are there?
</section>

<section>
No interface:
- Click program icon
- Type name, press <enter>
</section>

<section>
Command line interface (CLI):
- Arguments passed after program name
-- ls -lh
-- tar -czvvf my_new_tar_file.tgz ./*
- Interactive UI
-- fdisk
- Special cases:
-- servers
-- supercomputers
</section>

<section>
What makes CLI software easy/hard to use?
[Look at some documentation for some CLI utilities, try to complete a couple specific tasks]
</section>

<section>
Graphical user interface (GUI):
- Common operating systems
-- Windows, OS X, Gnome/KDE/XFCE for linux
- Most commercial or consumer-targeted software
-- Office
-- Photoshop
-- Firefox
- Special cases:
-- Websites
-- Touch screens
</section>

<section>
What makes GUI software easy/hard to use?
[Compare some interfaces, e.g. Yahoo & Google, Notepad & Word]
</section>

<section>
Simple software should have a simple interface.
Should complex software have a complex interface?
</section>

<section>
Creating simple interfaces for complex software is hard!
Broad principles:
- Know your users and what they know
- Exploit familiar interface patterns
- Exploit psychology and culture
</section>

<section>
Know your users.  Are they:
- Kids or adults
- One time or long term users
- Novices or experienced programmers
</section>

<section>
Know your users (cont.)
- Make common things easy
- Create basic/advanced alternative interfaces [Examples?]
- Create customizable interfaces [Examples?]
</section>

<section>
Exploit familiar interface patterns
- What does flipping a switch do?
- What does turning a dial do?
- Swiping? Ctrl + V? Clicking an 'X'?
[What are some more examples of ingrained controls?]
</section>

<section>
Exploit familiar interface patterns (cont.)
- Command line tools: reuse familiar flags!
[Find some CL tools, compare the flags and their meanings.]
</section>

<section>
Exploit psychology and culture
- If you step into an unfamiliar room, where do you look first for the light switch?
- How do you choose whether to push or pull a door?
- If something is flashing red, what does that mean? Other colors?
</section>

<section>
Exploit psychology (cont.)
- Put things where people will naturally look for them
-- Controls near the thing they control
- Group related things
- Hide confusing/misleading options
- Use good documentation/pop up messages to target subtle or misleading controls
</section>

<section>
Having many controls that are poorly organized can obscure the useful ones
Having excessive documentation for things that are obvious or unnecessary for the user can obscure the useful information
</section>

<section>
When you don't know how to make something better, find some guinea pigs!
Ask *them* what they expect to happen when they use your software.
