Project: Create software that will automatically generate webpages, e-mails, and/or text messages for a marketing campaign for a popular science magazine and website called "General Science".

Activity: Very quickly go through elicitation, analysis and specification phases.

Deliverable: Proposal describing approach.  Ensure that software requirements as understood are addressed in proposal.  Do not attempt to use formal specification language.

Approach:

Elicit. Organize software function around use cases.

Seperate requirements into functional and non-functional.

Analysis.  Look for contradictions and obviously wrong requirements.

Remember to follow the guidance for elicitation and Brooks' warnings.

Chief Executive Officer

Stated requirements - 

* Desire to reach current readers and new readers in North America, UK, and Asia with new marketing campaign.
* Drive magazine subscribers and website users to site for advertising revenue.
* Entice new users to visit the site.
* Encourage website visitors to subscribe to magazine.
* Encourage website visitors to purchase items from webstore.

Elicitable requirements - 

* We need a really good return on investment (ROI) - would like to increase online registrations by 50% and increase magazine subscriptions by 10%
* CEO is a slick talker and will quite frankly make a best guess and refer the questioner to other employees for 'details'.

Secrets - 

* As former CFO, finance is his forte.  Will defer to others in company for details.
* Magazine is in severe financial trouble.  Increase in revenue of 30% needed to keep magazine in business.  Additional magazine subscribers and page views are almost 100% increased margin.


Director of Marketing

Stated requirements - 

* Want to contact magazine subscribers and website visitors three times a week.
* Once a week they will be notified about breaking science news, once a week they will be notified about a page with information of interest to them and once a week it will be marketing with a link to something on sale in their webstore.
* Potential new users will be contacted only once a week.
* Subscribers and visitors need to be able select what type of science interests them.  They also need to be able to opt out.
* They have about 700K subscribers and 300K additional registered users.

Elicitable requirements - 

* Website already requires registration.  That is how they know who the website visitors are.  Subscribers automatically receive registrations.
* System needs to create the new websites with aggregated content once a week.
* The "breaking news" is whatever the lead article happens to be that day.
* The aggregated content sites have articles based on interest (Biology, Physics, Information Tech, etc.)
* Not all users speak English.  Some speak Chinese and Spanish.  E-mails will need to be translated to their native language.
* An outside vendor is providing leads (names, e-mail addresses) on potential new users.

Secrets - 

* He is not technically savvy.  Will not always use proper terms and will occasionally misuse terms. Does not understand or appreciate vigor required for software requirements.
* He hasn't thought about how the marketing messages will be input into the system.
* Is very fearful of losing his job if this project is not a success.


Jr. Science Editor

Stated requirements -

* Needs tool to select articles for weekly aggregated websites from all relevant articles from the past week.
* Can use CMS, but not that comfortable with it.  Would prefer tool autogenerate the pages.
* There will be three seperate pages, one for English, one for Spanish and one for Chinese.

Elicitable requirements/information - 

* Would prefer system to remind her when to select content for websites.
* Does not speak Spanish or Chinese.  The magazine has a translator for each language and three bilingual writers.
* Her primary job is to edit the work of multiple science writers.  Each science writer handles multiple disciplines. For example, one writer handles both archeology and geology.
* She uses Windows 7 as an OS.

Secrets - 

* Is not looking forward to the increase in her workload.  Science editor is primarily a writer, not a technologist. Wants new system to be as easy as possible to use.
* She is not aware that marketing wants a seperate page for multiple topic areas (Biology, Physics, Information Tech, etc.)  She thinks it is just one page per language.

 
Information Technology Director

Stated requirements - 

* The system must be compatible with our solution stack.  We use LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python)
* Django CMS is used by the website administrators, who work closely with the magazine article editors.
* Uses Exim as a mail server.  Already have scripts to autosend e-mails for subscription renewals and the like.

Elicitable requirements/information - 

* The MySQL database has a table with magazine subscribers and a different table with website subscribers. 
* Country where magazine incorporated has strict privacy laws.  Security is required for magazine and website subscribers.
* Django CMS is Python based.
* Has a staff consisting of a sysadmin, DBA, 2 website admins and IT support tech. The DBA and one of the website admins can write simple scripts and programs.
* The webstore is completely outsourced.  They just maintain links on their site to it.

Secrets - 

* Marketing never told him about purchasing leads from an outside vendor.
* Not happy about marketing selling the CEO about this idea without involving him.  Feels his staff could handle this just fine.

How are the moving parts coordinated?
Marketing and science editor have different ideas about web page content generation.
IT uninformed about outside vendor data.
