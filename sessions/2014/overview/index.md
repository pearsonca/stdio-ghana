###The Method of This Course

<aside class="notes" markdown="block">
What would we doing in a typical day in one of your other classes?

Make clear our expectations in this class:

 - "audience" questions will asked regularly: you need to try to answer, and be honest
 about your knowledge; okay to be wrong, not okay to try to hide it
 - the instructors will disagree: most of these points, there isn't a "right"
 answer
 - there will be lots of doing
