<p>Engage class concerning 20 questions.  Is this a game that Ghanaians are familiar with?</p>

<p>Play the classic version of it with class, let each student ask a question until all students get a chance or answer guessed.</p>

<p>Then look at http://www.20q.net/</p>

<p>Ah, the game has been automated.  How is that possible?  What on earth is a artificial neural net (ANN)?</p>

<p>Naturally, libraries have been made for it in Python.
The best known is <a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a>.</p>

<p>Neural nets belong to a very specialized branch of computer science called
artificial intelligence.  ANNs were at first overhyped until their limitations
were known.  Research, some of it quite successful, is ongoing.</p>
