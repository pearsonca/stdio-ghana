<div class="main">
<p>A Ghanaian business investor traveling abroad goes bowling as part of the trip,
enjoying it quite a bit.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Ghana, this investor sees that there are no bowling lanes in
sight, and decides that this is an excellent opportunity to bring a novel
activity to Ghana.</p>

<p>Being aware of the advantages of modern information technology, this investor
also wants the lanes to automate as much as possible (<em>e.g.</em>, computerized
inventory and accounting, automated game scoring, web publishing of high scores)
to provide the best customer experience.</p>

<p>Warmup: do a bit of research about bowling, and come up with a diagram of what
kind of systems the bowling lane will need, and what data will need to pass
between them.  What sort of records will need to be kept?  What sort of services
will the investor need to plan for?</p>
