Unless you are purely a hobbyist or a student, software projects are undertaken because an organization
needs the software to increase productivity of workers or to perform a task that cannot be done by a human worker.

The software engineering team must understand what the customer wants out of the software, so that they know
what to build.

Motivational Quotation #1

“The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.  No other part of the conceptual 
work is so difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements … No other part of the work so cripples the 
resulting system if done wrong.  No other part is more difficult to rectify later.”

Brooks, Fred P. (1986). "No Silver Bullet — Essence and Accident in Software Engineering". Proceedings of the IFIP 
Tenth World Computing Conference: 1069–1076.

Motivational Quotation #2

“Therefore the most important function that software builders do for their clients is the iterative extraction and 
refinement of the product requirements.  For the truth is, the clients do not know what they want.  They usually do 
not know what questions must be answered, and they almost never have thought of the problem in the detail that must be 
specified.”

A (semi-) formal definition of Software Requirement:

A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective, or needed to satisfy
a contract or other formal document.

</section>
<section>


Functional requirement – What the customer wants the software to do.

Nonfunctional requirement – Places constraints on how the software meets requirements.

</section>
<section>


Important Aside

Study of the issues surrounding software requirements could be the content of a semester long course,
a dissertation, a book.  There are many different software development methodologies, with proponents
of particular methods (often) bitterly disagreeing with each other on the subject.  Each software
development methodology has its own style of handling software requirements.

</section>
<section>


Thus, I cannot cover them all in one lesson.

I can, however, briefly give you my opinion on the subject of methodologies.  
They are situationally dependent.  For certain projects, methodology A can have great success,
for other projects the best choice might be methodology B.  Some methodologies that would be ideal cannot
be implemented due to external factors, such as contracts.

</section>
<section>


So, it is good to read up on or experience many from the following list: 
<dl>
<dt>Waterfall</dt>
<dt>Prototype model</dt>
<dt>Iterative</dt>
<dt>Spiral</dt>
<dt>Scrum</dt>
<dt>RUP</dt>
<dt>XP</dt>
<dt>Agile</dt>
<dt>TDD</dt>
<dt>FDD</dt>
</dl>

</section>

<section>


Another important definition!

Use Case: A description of important interactions between an actor (usually a person) and the software
system.  These interactions must yield a result of value to the actor.  Sometimes diagrams are used to
illustrate a use case, but these are rarely sufficient.

</section>

<section>

Here is  a brief overview of the formal style used commonly in software engineering literature.

</section>

<section>


Software Requirements can be broken into 5 Phases
<dl>
<dt>Elicitation</dt>
<dt>Analysis</dt>
<dt>Specification</dt>
<dt>Validation</dt>
<dt>Management</dt>
</dl>
</section>
<section>


Elicitation: Uncovering customer needs and wants and nonfunctional requirements.
 
Multiple sources of information can be used.
<dl>
<dt>Stakeholders (May have different needs and you need to meet them all)</dt>
<dt>Goals (How do the stakeholders see the software benefiting the organization?  Uncover nonfunctional
requirements)</dt>
<dt>Domain Knowledge (How is business done in this industry?)</dt>
<dt>Operation and organizational environment (Consistency)</dt>
</dl>
</section>
<section>

Multiple techniques can be used:

<dt>Interviews - 1v1 </dt><dt>
Facilitated meetings - groups </dt><dt>
Observation – of how proposed users currently perform tasks to be handled by the software </dt><dt>
Scenarios – Software developers describing sets of use cases to the customer.  This can identify misperceptions early one and uncover new requirements. </dt><dt>

	
</section>

<section>
All of these techniques require skill and experience.  This is a different skill set from writing functioning code!
</section>
<section>

Analysis.  In this phase, the requirements are studied to see if a system can be built from them.
Common flaws include:
<dl>
<dt>Contradictions</dt>
<dt>Incomplete</dt>
<dt>Vague</dt>
<dt>Obviously wrong.</dt>
</dl>

</section>
<section>

Specification.  Formal capture of the requirements into a properly formatted document.  Requirements must be:
<dl>
<dt>Specific – clear, concise and exclusive</dt>
<dt>Correct – must accurately describe the system function</dt>
<dt>Complete – must describe everything about the system</dt>
<dt>Consistent – non-contradictory or not-exclusive of other requirements</dt>
<dt>Attainable – possible for software to meet this goal</dt>
<dt>Verifiable – can we test that the requirement has been met?</dt>
</dl>

</section>
<section>


Validation. The stakeholders agree that the requirement meet their needs.
</section>
<section>

Management.  A successful project will have subject matter experts on the entire set of requirements.

The development team must ensure all requirements are met and tested.
</section>

<section>
Requirements can change (!) during a project.  When changes to requirements occur, this can
necessitate changes to other requirements and code already written.  This adds to development time.
It is critical that this additional time is accurately estimated.


The need to translate the customer’s requirements to technical specifications.

</section>
<section>

Exercise:

The class is broken up into teams, each of which is competing for a software development project.  
Each instructor is a stakeholder and can be interviewed for 10 minutes.  
(This requires that each instructor will need to role-play and have different goals and priorities)
Follow up questions may be asked at a roundtable discussion by all teams (round-robin).  
The team that best describes the system wins the contract.
