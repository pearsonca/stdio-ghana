Why Requirements?

Unless you are purely a hobbyist or a student, software projects
are undertaken because an organization needs the software to increase
productivity of workers or to perform a task that cannot be done economically
by a human worker.

The software engineering team must understand what the customer wants out of
the software, so that they know what to build.

Motivational Quotation \# 1

> The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to
> build.  No other part of the conceptual work is so difficult as establishing
> the detailed technical requirements... No other part of the work so cripples
> the resulting system if done wrong.  No other part is more difficult to
> rectify later.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Motivational Quotation \# 2

> Therefore the most important function that software builders do for their
> clients is the iterative extraction and refinement of the product
> requirements.  For the truth is, the clients do not know what they want.  They
> usually do not know what questions must be answered, and they almost never
> have thought of the problem in the detail that must be specified.

<section markdown="block">
##What is a Software Requirement?

A condition or capability needed by a customer to solve a problem or achieve an
objective, or needed to satisfy a contract or other formal document.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Two types of software requirements:

**Functional** - What the customer wants the software to do.

**Nonfunctional** - Places constraints on how the software meets requirements.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Important Note...  

Study of the issues surrounding software requirements could be the content of a
semester long course, a dissertation, or a book.

There are many different software development ***methodologies***, with
proponents of particular methods often (bitterly) disagreeing with each other on
the subject.  

Each software development methodology has its own style of handling software requirements.

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Thus, I cannot cover them all in one lesson.

I can, however, briefly give you my opinion on the subject of methodologies.
They are situationally dependent.  For certain projects, methodology A can have
great success, for other projects the best choice might be methodology B.  Some
methodologies that would be ideal cannot be implemented due to external factors,
such as contracts.

</section>

<section markdown="block">
So, it is good to read up on or experience many from the following list:

| Some | Methods |
|:-:|:-:|
| [Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) | [Prototype model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) |
| [Iterative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) | [Spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) |
| [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) | [Rational Unified Process (RUP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process) |
| [Extreme Programming (XP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) | [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) |
| [Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) | [Feature Driven Development (FDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development) |

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Another important definition!

*Use Case*: A description of important interactions between an actor (usually a
person) and the software system.  These interactions must yield a result of
value to the actor.  Sometimes diagrams are used to illustrate a use case, but
these are rarely sufficient.

Use cases are a primary means of discovering requirements.

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Software Requirements can be broken into 5 Phases

1. Elicitation
2. Analysis
3. Specification
4. Validation
5. Management
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Elicitation: Uncovering customer needs and wants and nonfunctional requirements.

Multiple sources of information can be used.

- Stakeholder Needs - They may have overlapping or disjoint sets of needs.
- Stakeholder Goals - How do the stakeholders see the software benefiting the
organization?
- Domain Knowledge - What is common business practice in this industry?
- Operation and organizational environment - Is there consistency or conflicts?

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Multiple techniques can be used for elicitation.

- Interviews - 1v1
- Facilitated meetings - groups
- Observation - of how proposed users currently perform tasks to be handled by
the software
- Scenarios - Software developers describing sets of use cases to the customer.
This can identify misperceptions early on and uncover new requirements.

These techniques require skill and experience.  This is a different skill set
from writing functioning code!
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Analysis: The study of requirements to determine if a system can be built from
them.

Common flaws include requirements that:

- contradict
- are incomplete
- are vague
- are obviously wrong

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Specification:  The formal capture of the requirements into a properly formatted
document.  

Requirements must be:

- Specific - clear, concise and exclusive
- Correct - must accurately describe the system function
- Complete - must describe everything about the system
- Consistent - non-contradictory or not-exclusive of other requirements
- Attainable - possible for software to meet this goal
- Verifiable - can we test that the requirement has been met?

</section>

<section markdown="block">
Validation: An agreement by the customers that the requirements meet their needs.

This is typically accomplished by the customer reading and agreeing to the
specification.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Management.  

Why would you need to manage requirements after the specification is validated
by the customer?
</section>

<section markdown="block">
Two of the many good reasons.

Because requirements can *CHANGE* during a project!  When changes to
requirements occur, this can necessitate changes to other requirements and code
already written.

Because the completion of requirements must be accounted for and tested before
the project is delivered.  One or more members of the development team must
verify that all requirements are completed and tested.

A successful project will have one or more subject matter experts on the entire
set of requirements.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##Class Exercise

The class is broken up into teams, each of which is competing for a software
development project.

The software project will automate a marketing initiative for a science
magazine/website.  Each team will elicit software requirements, analyze them and
draft a specification.

Each instructor will role-play a stakeholder and can be interviewed by each team
separately for 10 minutes.

The team that creates the best specification wins the contract.
