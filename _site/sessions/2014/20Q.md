Engage class concerning 20 questions.  Is this a game that Ghanaians are familiar with?

Play the classic version of it with class, let each student ask a question until all students get a chance or answer guessed.

Then look at http://www.20q.net/

Ah, the game has been automated.  How is that possible?  What on earth is a artificial neural net (ANN)?

Naturally, libraries have been made for it in Python.  The best known is PyBrain: http://pybrain.org/

Neural nets belong to a very specialized branch of computer science called artificial intelligence.  ANNs were at first overhyped until their limitations were known.  Research, some of it quite successful, is ongoing.
